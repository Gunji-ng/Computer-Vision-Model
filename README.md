# computer_vision_model

Sometimes, consumers see (in public) items that they would love to buy but they might not know the name/model of the product. It would be great if they could just upload an image of the item an have the product identified.
This is a Demo application that allows users to upload pictures of items they are interested in and have the product identified. This would be useful for ecommerce stores as users could get results of products matching the desired item by simply uploading an image.
As this is just a demo, the model was trained on 5 products only:
* iphone12_pro_max
* jbl_charge3
* nintendo_switch
* ps4_controller
* yeezy_boost_350
